Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

https://prod.liveshare.vsengsaas.visualstudio.com/join?F6E3A9BBB48BA44DF624E629B533F735EB3A


* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Game Idea:

The legend of zelda like game 
Fighting monsters to earn rewards etc etc

Game Rules:

board size: 25 x 20

players can move using wasd 
players can attack using spacebar (diagonal and orthogonal)
players can pickup gems and use them to buy things in the shop (walk over) 
users can open the shop and use gems to buy more health, wepon upgrades and special wepons (extra) 
beat 3 rooms in a row to beat the game



Major Game Elements:

player model
enemy model
obstacles
if you die you have to go back and restart
players start with 3 medicine in there inventory (displayed at bottom, only shows medicine)
if they run out of medice to heal then they have to restart
players have health 

    'obstacle': "\U0001FAA8 ",# 🪨
    'sword' : "\U0001F5E1", # 🗡️
    'empty': "  ",
    'skeleton' : "\U0001F480", # 💀
    'zombie': "\U0001F9DF", # 🧟  
    'ruppee' : "\U0001F48E", # 💎
    'Player_Icon' : "\U0001F9DD", # 🧝


players get score increce when they pick up gems and kill enimeis
players take damage when walking onto an enieme without killing it and when an enemy walks onto the same space as the player

Gameplay Process:
player has to walk around and kill other things without dying
they get better and better gear and game ends when they die/quit

I have decided to give up on adding weqapons as they make the game just a bit too complicated and i prefer the current gameplay work of just attacking with 'G'
It works fine as is and would prefer to add more complex aditions like more dungeon rooms and diffrent monsters/items to the game
I also want to add the healing functions
And having weapons were making some aspects of gameplay clunky
Next i want to add a store where you can spend points to upgrade health and attack range and maybe a point mulitplyer
Another cool thing to add would be enimeis with more health
one way i would do this is make an enemy class where eniemies store health and other info in their class info
