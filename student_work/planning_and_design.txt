Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Game Idea:

The legend of zelda like game 
Fighting monsters to earn rewards etc etc

Game Rules:

board size: 25 x 20

players can move using wasd or arrow keys
players can attack using spacebar/smth else
players can pickup and choose to use new items
beat 3 rooms in a row to beat the game 


Major Game Elements:

weapons like sword hammer axe
player model
enemy model
obstacles
if you die you have to go back and restart
players start with 3 medicine in there inventory 
if they run out of medice to heal then they have to restart
players have health 



    'obstacle': "\U0001FAA8 ",# 🪨
    'empty': "  "


Gameplay Process:
player has to walk around and kill other things without dying
they get better and better gear and game ends when they die/quit

I have decided to give up on adding weqapons as they make the game just a bit too complicated and i prefer the current gameplay work of just attacking with 'G'
It works fine as is and would prefer to add more complex aditions like more dungeon rooms and diffrent monsters/items to the game
I also want to add the healing functions
And having weapons were making some aspects of gameplay clunky
Next i want to add a store where you can spend points to upgrade health and attack range and maybe a point mulitplyer
Another cool thing to add would be enimeis with more health
one way i ould do this is make an enemy class where eniemies store health and other info in their class info
